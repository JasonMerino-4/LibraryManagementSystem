# LibraryManagementSystem
**Date:** August 2023
**Credits:** Starter code provided by Adam Koehler

Summary: This is a library management system designed to be used inside a terminal. The expected format is visible inside the exampleLibrary.txt but for clarity each line should first contain the book title, then ISBN number (ex: 000-0-00-000000-0) and the book status (0: in libary, 1: checked out, 2: on loan, 3: unknown). So each the title, ISBN and Status must be seperated by commas in order for the program to work.
